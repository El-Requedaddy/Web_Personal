## Hi, I'm Carlos Requena 👋

I am a software developer passionate about creating video games and graphics engines. I specialize in C++, Unity, and OpenGL.

Over time, I've found myself leaning towards AI and neural networks.

I'm a lover of Japanese culture and its language, having studied the language to a professional proficiency level.

### Experience in Japan

For a year, I had the honor of studying in Japan as an exchange student at Ritsumeikan University, where I was able to develop my skills in the language and artificial intelligence.

Of course, I was also able to enjoy the entertainment culture that Japan offers.
